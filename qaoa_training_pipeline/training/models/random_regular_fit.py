    The class works by transfering parameters of learned graphs to the new instance.
    This is done by computing the average degree of the nodes in the graph and then
    selecting the model for the graph with the closest regularity.

    Important note: The default model on which this class relies only supports graphs
    with regularity `k` in  `[3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]`. In the future this should be extended

        In this model, to each `k` regular graph are associated `PowerFunction`s whose argument
        is the number of nodes `n` in the graph. Each function outputs one parameter such as beta
        or gamma. The functions are loaded from a file. Therefore, in the returned datastructure,
        the first key is the parameter and the second key is the graph order. The value of the
        inner dict is the power function. An example, of this data structure is

        ..parsed-literal::

            "beta1": {
                "degree": {

        Here, `beta1` indicates the beta of depth-one QAOA. The degree key makes it clear that
        we are storing data following the degree of the random `k` regular graphs in the nested
        dictionary. Finally, the keys in the inner most dictionary are the power `a` and the
        values are the coefficients `b` of the expression `b * n**a` where `n` is the number
        of nodes in the graphs.
